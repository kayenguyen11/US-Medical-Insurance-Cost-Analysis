# US-Medical-Insurance-Cost-Analysis
In this project, I will be investigating a medical insurance costs dataset in a .csv file using the Python skills that I have developed.

I bullt out analysis funtions and class methods to analyze the age, regions, smoking status, gender, number of children. Besides, I try to examine if the insurance cost is affected by any other element.
